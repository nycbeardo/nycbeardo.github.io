                <p>Hi, Im Montique Stevens, a full stack web developer and designer from New York City. I enjoy everything
                  involving web design, user experience, human-computer interaction, and the internet of things. My passion
                  for design and technology started from my youth and eventually transitioned into me pursuing a degree in
                  Computer Information Systems and currently in pursuit of another in Multimedia Computing with a focus on
                  Cognitive Science. I been naviagting the world of web development for the past 3 years, picking up and
                  honing my skills along the way.</p>
                <p>In addition to spending my time working with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I also work with essential
                  frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Propeller. On my downtime, you can find me hanging out on
                  twitter or expressing my love of sights, tastes, and sounds on Instagram. I am also a avid foodie and
                  regularly take pics for my Instagram feed as well as for my WordPress blog.</p>
